Let us assume that we own a string of white and black beads, like

$$\circ \bullet \bullet \bullet \circ \circ \bullet$$

and the game \citep{VanLeeuwen_1990a,Dershowitz_1993} consists in
removing two adjacent beads and replace them with only one according
to some rules, for example

$$
\bullet \; \circ \xrightarrow{\smash{\alpha}} \bullet \qquad\qquad
\circ \; \bullet \xrightarrow{\smash{\beta}} \bullet \qquad\qquad
\bullet \; \bullet \xrightarrow{\smash{\gamma}} \circ
$$

The rules $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ make up a simple string-rewriting system. Rules $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can be conceived as `A black bead absorbs the white bead next to it.' The goal of this game is to end up with as few beads as possible, so our example may lead to the following rewrites:
